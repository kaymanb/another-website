# Another Website

Another new website. Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

* Deployed using [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)
* [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
* HTTPS through [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)

## Why?

At work and in other projects, all of these decisions have been made for me. I want to be able to build my own modern websites from the ground up.

## What's next?

* Change the colour scheme + font
* Update resume + blurb
* Add tracking
