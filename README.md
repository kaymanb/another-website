# Another Website

My own website boilerplate. Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
* [Functional TSLint rules](https://github.com/jonaskello/tslint-immutable)

# Why?

At work and in other projects, all of these decisions have been made for me. I want to be able to build my own modern websites from the ground up.

# What's next?

* [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/)
